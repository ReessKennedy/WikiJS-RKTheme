## What ‚ö°
Style (CSS) alterations for js.wiki. 
## Why ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
WikiJS is great but the default design is overdone for my tastes and needs. 

Elements on the page distract me from the part of central importance: The content. 

This is an attempt to fix this for my own usage and usage with my team. 
## Specific Changes üìã
- Remove raised boxes
- Add flat background behind page navigation sidebar so it's simple and unified instead of a group of boxes ... 
- Remove print and social boxes
- Remove H1-H6 underlines and underline gradients
- Remove gradients throughout except for header, left that one
- Body text spacing changed
- Body UL and UL LI spacing changed and caret changed back to bullet
- Edit button on page repositioned and made more prominent
- Table of contents condensed to show more info in small space and carets removed
- Left navigation sidebar icon colors changed to better differentiate between FOLDERS and PAGES
- Main navigation changed from strange, nonstandard icon to back arrow
- Additional text of "Pages" added after browse to make it more clear what is being browsed

## Questions & Todos

### Draft
This actually took me a few hours and I was getting anxious as I saw more I could do so I stopped and just published what I had. It can be refined more and I still had some questions but just getting something out and can refine later if I feel time is worthwhile on it. 
### Seo -  H1
- Issue: The page title is inserted but a div element and then WikiJS auto populates with an H1 when you create a new page suggesting you should start with this
